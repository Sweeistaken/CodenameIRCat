## IRCat Configuration

## Used as the server/network's display name. MUST NOT CONTAIN SPACES!
name: foo

## The hostname the server should go by, such as ircserver1.example.com
host: 127.0.0.1

## The identifier for this server, such as the location (Used in whois)
identifier: somewhere in the universe

## The path of the data file to be used by NickServ, ChanServ, etc
## This MUST be a file path.
## Recommended to use a .db extension because it is an SQLite database
## If the path doesn't exist, it will be created, make sure it is either blank or generated by ircat!
data-path: /path/to/data/for/ircat.db

## The MOTD and its file if applicable
motd: |
  CONFIG.YML EXAMPLE
  Replace this with your own motd!

# motd-file: /etc/motd

## The ping timeout in seconds, default is 255

# ping-timeout: 255

## Restrict what IP(s) the server runs on, separated by spaces, useful if you have alternate IPs/Networks

# restrict-ip: 127.0.0.1

## SSL enable, certificate, and private key.

# ssl: on
# ssl_cert: /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain/fullchain.pem
# ssl_pkey: /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain/privkey.pem

## Used as passwords before 0.0.9
## But still used in multi-server
## Make a secure fernet key using openssl rand -hex 32

# fernet-key: MaybeUseOpensslRand

## A file used to store IP bans (K-Lines) and their reasons
## You can also use `sql` to make it use the SQL engine, but that option is not implemented, but will be later in 0.0.9

ban-provider: /path/to/bans.txt

## Mail server settings for PawServ

smtp_host: smtp.example.com
smtp_port: 25
smtp_starttls: off
smtp_username: pawserv@example.com
smtp_password: examplePassword

## If you setup a webchat, use this passphrase to let IRCat know that instance is trusted to set IP.
webirc_pass: helloworld

## Use of modules in the /modules folder, or in an absolute path specified.
## You want your protection modules BEFORE the ban engine.
modules:
  - sqlite_local
  - botnet_protect
  - ban_engine
  - pawserv
