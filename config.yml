## The identifier for this server, such as the location (Used in whois)
identifier: somewhere in the universe

## The path of the data file to be used by NickServ, ChanServ, etc
## This MUST be a file path.
## Recommended to use a .db extension because it is an SQLite database
## If the path doesn't exist, it will be created, make sure it is either blank or generated by ircat!
data-path: /path/to/data/for/ircat.db

## The MOTD and its file if applicable
motd: |
  CONFIG.YML EXAMPLE
  Replace this with your own motd!

## Restrict what IP(s) the server runs on, separated by spaces, useful if you have alternate IPs/Networks

## SSL enable, certificate, and private key.

# ssl: on
# ssl_cert: /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain/fullchain.pem
# ssl_pkey: /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain/privkey.pem

## Deprecated, but continue using fernet-key to make sure users registered before IRCat 0.0.9 are ported to Argon2.
## You can, of course, ignore this if you haven't been using IRCat before 0.0.9

# fernet-key: MaybeUseOpensslRand
